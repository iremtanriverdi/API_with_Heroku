# Heroku-Demo

This repo includes Deploying the model on  open source cloud  "Heroku" (Deployment should be API based as well as web app).
- First read the dataset and deploy a model on python.
- Then, create the API of the model using Flask in python. (If you create the model API until this step, the API will only open on your own computer.)
- You need to upload the model API in any open source cloud so that everyone can see it. Heroku is one of those open sources.
